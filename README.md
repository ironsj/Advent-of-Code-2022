# Advent of Code 2022
My solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

To challenge myself I have decided to use a different programming language every 5 days:
* **Python** (1-5)
* **TypeScript** (6-10)
* **C#** (11-15)
* **Kotlin** (16-20)
* **Rust** (21-25) <-- First time using Rust!

Overall, taking part in this challenge has been a wonderful experience. I have been able to brush up on my skills with programming languages that I have not used in awhile while also learning new strategies to solve challenging problems. The Reddit community for the Advent of Code is very active and it was exciting to learn from other peoples' clever solutions. I can take what I have learned and apply it to future problems I may run into.
